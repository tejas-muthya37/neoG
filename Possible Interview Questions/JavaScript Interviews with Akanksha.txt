Interview Prep Notes

Talk about your work experience, projects at neoG, tech stack in your intro.

Don't speak ill of your current job.

Ask the HR about the rounds.

Differences b/n map and forEach - map returns a new array and method chaining is possible.

let and const cannot be re-declared within it's scope.

== converts the operands to the same type and checks. === strict check. type and value should be same.

why is the type of null an 'Object'?

implicit and explicit binding (this)

function.call(object)

function.apply(object, [param1, param2])

call is when you have 0 or 1 parameters, apply is when you have array of parameters (multiple parameters)

call invokes then and there. bind is when you want to store and invoke later.

async and defer - script inside head and no async/defer -> HTML parsing paused and script is fetched.

script inside body and no async/defer -> HTML parsing finished -> script fetching

script async src="" inside head -> parsing is paused and continues after script execution

script defer src="" inside head -> HTML parsing finished and script is executed later. fetching happens in parallel
